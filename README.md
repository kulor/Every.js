# Every.js
Every aims to provide a clean way of getting a list of dates based on some simple queries.

## Examples of queries this will support:

*   `every.day(2)`
*   `every.day('Friday')`
*   `every.day(['Monday', 'Friday'])`
*   `every.weekday()`
*   `every.lastDayOfMonth()`
*   `every.lastWeekDayOfMonth()`

## Output of these queries would look something like:

`['20111223T0000', '20111224T0000']`
